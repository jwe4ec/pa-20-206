# Background

The present scripts conduct preliminary analyses for [Professor Jessie Gibson](https://www.nursing.virginia.edu/people/js6zn/)'s NIH [K23](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/career-development/k23) ([PA-20-206](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-206.html)) submission titled "Modification of Threat Interpretation Bias to Reduce Anxiety in Neurodegenerative Movement Disorders."

# Data

The present scripts import preliminary datasets from two studies, for which recruitment is ongoing.

## MDIB Development Study

`Prelim Data for Jeremy 2-3-22_MDIB.csv` are preliminary long-format data from a RedCap survey of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) administered at two time points. The study's purpose is to develop the Movement Disorders Interpretation Bias Scale (MDIB). Bot responses have already been cleaned from the data by Dr. Gibson and a graduate research assistant.

Participants with above-threshold anxiety symptoms (NeuroQoL) are eligible to participate in the MindTrails-HD pilot study (see below).

## MindTrails-HD Pilot Study

`Prelim Data for Jeremy 2-3-22_MindTrails-HD pilot.csv` are preliminary long-format data from a RedCap survey for a pilot study of an adaptation of interpretation bias training (MindTrails for Huntington's Disease; MindTrails-HD) for anxious (NeuroQoL) patients with HD. The data are raw, with no cleaning for bots required.
